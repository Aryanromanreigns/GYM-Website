🏋️‍♂️ Gym Website
😀 Motivation

Fitness and health are at the core of a balanced lifestyle. Many gym websites lack modern design, responsiveness, or engaging features.
This project focuses on building a responsive and user-friendly fitness website that can serve as a foundation for gyms, trainers, or fitness enthusiasts to showcase services, plans, and contact information.

🎯 Project Goals

Create a modern and responsive fitness website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Add Login & Register pages for user authentication

Provide structured sections like About, Plans, Trainers, Features, Stats, and Contact

Make the design mobile-friendly with smooth navigation

Allow easy customization and extension for more features

🛠 Project Approach

The project is primarily front-end based and uses the following technologies:

HTML5 → For structure

CSS3 → For styling and responsiveness

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) → For interactivity (navigation toggle, modal, back-to-top button, etc.)

Additional Features:

Hero Section → with background image & overlay

Login & Register Pages → basic forms for authentication

Responsive Navbar → with burger menu for small screens

Reusable Cards & Sections → for trainers, plans, features, testimonials
